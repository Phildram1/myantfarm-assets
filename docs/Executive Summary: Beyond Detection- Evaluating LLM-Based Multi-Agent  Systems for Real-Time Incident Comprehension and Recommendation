 ABSTRACT
 Organizations operating digital infrastructure face a growing gap between detection and comprehension of
 incidents. While monitoring tools generate alerts within seconds, understanding why an outage occurred
 and what to do next often takes minutes or hours—causing revenue loss, SLA penalties, and customer
 dissatisfaction. Our study aims to assess this latency by evaluating large language model (LLM)–based
 multi-agent reasoning for real-time incident comprehension and decision support.
 I.
 BUSINESS PROBLEM
 Enterprises in telecom, cloud, and IoT depend on distributed observability systems such as Datadog, Jira, and
 Slack. The volume and heterogeneity of data make root-cause isolation slow and cognitively expensive, often leading
 to significant revenue impact from outages and degraded customer experience. Traditional dashboards visualize data
 but rarely deliver actionable narratives. This study investigates how orchestrated LLM agents can reduce incident
 comprehension latency—the time between signal and usable understanding.
 II. APPROACH
 Areproducible Docker-based simulation was built with four core services: the Evaluator, Multi-Agent Coordinator,
 LLM backend (quantized Llama 3.2 via Ollama), and Analyzer. Three experimental conditions were tested—C1
 (baseline/manual), C2 (single-agent), and C3 (multi-agent orchestration). Performance was evaluated using two
 metrics: Time-to-Usable Understanding (T2U) and Decision Quality (DQ).
 III. KEY FINDINGS
 Across 348 simulated trials, the multi-agent condition (C3) reduced comprehension latency by 58% and improved
 decision quality by 48% compared with baseline processes. Results converged after 30–40 trials, indicating robust
ness of improvement. The architecture establishes a foundation for measurable gains in reliability, interpretability,
 and time-to-decision.
 IV. STRATEGIC RELEVANCE
 Incident comprehension delay directly translates to operational cost. Reducing T2U by 50–60% yields material
 savings in downtime and human triage effort. Integrating governed access (Model Context Protocol, MCP) and
 evidence grounding (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG) ensures enterprise readiness without compromising
 security or traceability. The framework is domain-agnostic and extendable to Industrial IoT and critical infrastructure
 monitoring.
 V. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS
 Our study demonstrates that orchestrated LLM agents can transform incident response from reactive detection
 to proactive comprehension. While MCP and RAG were conceptually integrated but not active during testing, they
 represent the next step toward deployable, auditable AIOps environments where noise becomes actionable narrative
 in seconds. Next-phase testing will extend the framework to live telemetry using MCP for secure data mediation
 and RAG for context retrieval. These integrations will enable quantitative ROI analysis through reduced Mean
 Time to Mitigate (MTTM), SLA compliance improvement, and automation efficiency. A 10–15% improvement
 in comprehension efficiency at enterprise scale could translate into multimillion-dollar savings annually, bridging
 academic rigor with measurable operational impact.
